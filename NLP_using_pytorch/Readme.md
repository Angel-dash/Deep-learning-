# PyTorch Training Loop Steps

The training loop in PyTorch involves several key steps to ensure that the model learns effectively from the training data. Here's a breakdown of these steps:

## Forward Pass

1. **Model Input**: The model takes the input data (`x_train`) and performs its forward pass calculations. This is done by calling the `forward()` method of the model with the input data.


## Calculate the Loss

2. **Loss Calculation**: The model's predictions (`y_pred`) are compared to the ground truth labels (`y_train`). The difference between these predictions and the actual values is quantified using a loss function (`loss_fn`), which evaluates how wrong the predictions are.


## Zero Gradients

3. **Zeroing Gradients**: Before calculating the gradients, it's important to zero out any existing gradients in the optimizer. This ensures that the gradients are calculated from scratch for each training step, preventing accumulation from previous steps.


## Perform Backpropagation

4. **Backward Pass**: The gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter in the model are computed. This process, known as backpropagation, starts from the loss and propagates backward through the network, computing the gradient of the loss with respect to each parameter that has `requires_grad=True`.


## Step the Optimizer

5. **Update Parameters**: Finally, the optimizer updates the parameters of the model based on the computed gradients. This step moves the model closer to the optimal solution by adjusting the parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss.


This sequence of steps is repeated for each batch of data in the training dataset, allowing the model to learn from the data over time.```
