# Movie Genre Classification Project

This project delves into the classification of movie genres based on plot summaries. Utilizing a dataset obtained from Kaggle, featuring around 27 diverse genres, we concentrated on five prominent genres and sampled 1000 instances for each. Our aim was to develop a robust classification model employing natural language processing techniques.

## Methodology

We experimented with three distinct algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Following rigorous evaluation, we observed superior performance with ANN and SVM compared to logistic regression. However, challenges related to overfitting persisted across all models.

## Key Techniques

- Leveraged TF-IDF for feature extraction
- Conducted multiclass classification
- Analyzed results using confusion matrices

## Findings

Our findings highlight the effectiveness of ANN and SVM in movie genre classification. Nevertheless, the issue of overfitting remains a significant challenge. This research contributes to the advancement of automated genre classification systems, offering implications for various applications in the entertainment industry.
